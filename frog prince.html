            Once upon a time, there one was a house in San Jose. The house address was
        23345. There was a family living in the house. There were 4 people. The 4
        people's names were John, James, Mary, and Maya. James: the youngest of all his 
        family members. James had a dream of becoming the prince. He as the prince in his 
        dream was so so naughty and funny. One day, he was doing a very naughty thing. He was playing
        with mud. He accidentlly throw mud to a witch. The witch was so so so angry that she casted a 
        spell on James. Even though he appolgied to the witch, the witch would not listen. He tried to give money, do 
        chores for the witch, and  help her out with her spells, but she still did not want to turn him back to a person.
        Finally, James did the nicest thing he had ever done to the witch. When the witch hurt herself when she was mountain
         climbing, James helped the witch even though she did evil thing to him. After she felt better, she turned 
        James into a prince again. He woke up the next morning and told everyone about his dream. His mom, his dad, his sister, his 
        friends, etc. enjoyed it!
